== Contact Form with rails 3.1.3

if you need info about the method persisted? look this:

persisted?()
Returns if the record is persisted, i.e. it's not a new record and it was not destroyed.

Source:

# File activerecord/lib/active_record/persistence.rb, line 17
def persisted?
  !(new_record? || destroyed?)
end
